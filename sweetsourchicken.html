    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the flavors of our favorite Asian takeout, here's a sweet and sour chicken recipe that uses canned pineapple tidbits, with the usual veggies. In order to make it sheet-pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container, for up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans pineapple tidbits in juice</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
        <li>1.5 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
